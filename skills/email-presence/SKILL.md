# Email Presence

This transport connects one IMAP mailbox and SMTP sender to an owner-created
Presence binding. Incoming messages are persisted before they are submitted to
the loopback Presence endpoint. Replies use `Message-ID`, `In-Reply-To`, and
`References` so normal mail clients keep one conversation thread.

The transport carries provider facts only. Identity, memory, behavior, and
capabilities are selected by the host Presence binding. The companion keeps its
SQLite inbox/outbox and cursor in the skill state directory, survives restarts,
and retries transient provider or Host failures with bounded backoff.

## Setup

1. Configure and grant `EMAIL_IMAP_HOST`, `EMAIL_SMTP_HOST`, and `EMAIL_USER`.
   Ports default to IMAPS 993 and SMTP 587 (STARTTLS); SMTP 465 uses TLS directly.
2. Use `EMAIL_AUTH_MODE=password` (default) and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` for an app
   password, or `EMAIL_AUTH_MODE=oauth2` with an existing OAuth access token in
   `EMAIL_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN`. For persistent corporate Gmail access, provide
   existing `EMAIL_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `EMAIL_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` and
   `EMAIL_OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN`; access tokens refresh automatically. Gmail uses
   `imap.gmail.com`, `smtp.gmail.com`, and the `https://mail.google.com/` scope.
   The skill does not start login, create accounts or configure domain delegation.
   A service-account JSON by itself is not a mailbox credential for this skill.
3. Create a Presence binding for provider `email`, account `EMAIL_USER`, and a
   selected RFC Message-ID conversation root or `*`; save its binding ID in the
   skill settings. Enable the skill after grants and review.
4. The first successful connection records UIDNEXT as the activation baseline;
   only subsequent arrivals enter Presence. Existing mail remains fully reachable
   through `email_search` and `email_read`. Disabling/re-enabling preserves the
   baseline, so new mail received while offline is processed when it returns.

## Mailbox tools and transport behavior

- `email_search` accepts ordinary IMAP search tokens (ALL, UNSEEN, FROM, SUBJECT,
  SINCE, HEADER) and returns UID/UIDVALIDITY, which `email_read` uses to address
  the same message even if other messages disappear. Mailbox tools do not submit
  historical mail to Presence or alter the automatic intake cursor.
- `email_mailbox` lists/creates folders, copies/moves individual messages and
  adds/removes flags. Archive by moving to the desired folder. UID MOVE needs
  server support; the skill never substitutes a mailbox-wide expunge.
- `email_draft` saves a text draft in a selected mailbox folder without sending.
- `email_send` queues text and supports reply headers. Supply a stable request_id
  when retrying the same logical send; `email_receipt` reports its actual state.
- IMAP intake persists messages before cursor advancement. UIDVALIDITY changes
  rescan from the original activation date and deduplicate by Message-ID.
- The companion backs off from 5 seconds to the configured idle interval.
  Polling, host turns and outbound delivery run independently, so a model can
  send an early message while continuing its work. There is no automatic reply
  text, acknowledgement timer, second scheduler or separate memory engine.
- Normal retries reuse the stored Message-ID. SMTP cannot guarantee exactly-once
  delivery if a connection/process dies after the server accepted DATA but before
  the receipt is stored. Such sends are `uncertain`, never automatically resent.
  Inspect the receipt and sent mailbox before making an explicit new send.
- The `status` extension route exposes poll health, activation/cursor state, queue
  counts and recent receipts. Host Skills/Activity shows companion process health.

## Delivery history

Hosts advertising `presence_delivery_version=1` receive `/presence/delivery`
observations from the existing outbox. SMTP success is recorded as `accepted`,
meaning server acceptance, never recipient inbox delivery or reading. A partial
recipient refusal retains the accepted subset and the actual refusal evidence;
an ambiguous SMTP disconnect or a process lost while sending remains uncertain
and is never automatically resent. Reports retain the transmitted text, subject,
recipients, Message-ID, reply headers and producer origin, including sends made
after the model turn ends.

Provider state and immutable report payload commit together before the history
callback. ACK/backoff stays in the same outbox, and its worker owns a concurrent
report attempt so unavailable history does not delay later mail. Restart and lost
ACK reuse the original report without another SMTP send. Automatic immediate and
deferred replies preserve the Host's echoed reporting mode. Old Hosts and migrated
rows continue normal sending with mode 0; terminal legacy rows are not imported.
`email_receipt` and `status` expose pending reports and reporting availability;
queued mail is never logged as accepted speech. No new login or permission.

## Incoming context and replies

Incoming Presence events retain the From address and display name, all To and Cc
addresses, Date, and decoded named From/To/Cc/Reply-To headers. Reply-To stays
separate from the From actor. Automatic responses go to Reply-To when supplied,
or From otherwise; To and Cc are context, not an automatic reply-all list. The
configured mailbox account identifies the receiving transport, even when that
mailbox is absent from To because delivery used Bcc or a mailing-list alias.

Attachment descriptors expose filenames and MIME types. Successfully staged
parts include immutable state paths and `content_available: true`; parts that
exceed an inbound limit or use an unsupported MIME shape retain
`content_available: false` plus an error descriptor. The full raw RFC822 source
is staged as an artifact so a clipped part remains recoverable. These message
facts are retained with the inbox across restarts. Existing inbox rows keep
their original content and receipts, with new context unavailable.

Text, reply threading and ordinary MIME attachments are supported. Incoming
attachments are copied into immutable, skill-owned staged files before a
Presence turn; the Host receives their metadata and staged paths separately.
Outbound sends and drafts accept staged file attachments, To/Cc/Bcc envelopes,
and optional multipart/alternative HTML. `reply_all` derives Reply-To/From plus
original To/Cc recipients, removes the sending mailbox and de-duplicates
addresses. SMTP sends keep Bcc envelope-only; drafts retain a Bcc header for
later manual sending. Partial SMTP
recipient acceptance is retained in the receipt alongside accepted/refused
recipients, while ambiguous acceptance remains `uncertain` and is never
automatically resent. HTML-only inbound mail remains available as plain text
with explicit body truncation disclosure.
The separate public `email` utility remains available; this package neither
replaces nor removes its tools.
