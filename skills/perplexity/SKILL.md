# Perplexity Research

An LLM-grounded web search extension using OpenRouter's `openrouter:web_search`
server tool. Sends your question to a model that can search the web in real-time
and returns a synthesized answer with citations.

## Requirements

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` configured in Settings

## How it works

1. Your query is sent to OpenRouter with the `openrouter:web_search` tool enabled
2. The model (Claude Sonnet by default) decides when to search and synthesizes results
3. You get a grounded answer plus a list of source URLs

## Capabilities

- **Agent tool**: `ext_..._perplexity_research` — deep research with citations
- **HTTP route**: `POST /api/extensions/perplexity/research` — JSON body `{"query": "..."}`
- **Widget**: declarative form on the Widgets page

## Network policy

Connects to OpenRouter API (`openrouter.ai`) only. The actual web search
is performed server-side by OpenRouter's infrastructure.
